# Rule: Mindful Task Implementation and Reflection (with Strict Protocol)

## Philosophy

This process transforms task execution into a cycle of **Plan -> Implement -> Reflect**. The goal is meaningful partnership. The AI must differentiate between simple (Mechanical) and complex (Substantive) tasks.

## Guiding Principle: Task Significance

### 1. Mechanical Tasks
*   **Examples:** Creating empty files, installing dependencies, configuring linters.
*   **Behavior:** The AI should announce the task(s), execute them, and then **immediately update the task list**. It can batch several related mechanical tasks.

### 2. Substantive Tasks
*   **Examples:** Implementing an algorithm, designing state, writing business logic.
*   **Behavior:** These tasks **must** use the full **Plan -> Implement -> Reflect** cycle.

## The Strict Implementation Cycle

1.  **Assess the Task:** The AI reads the next sub-task and determines if it's Mechanical or Substantive.

2.  **Execute Based on Significance:**

    *   **If Mechanical:**
        *   **AI:** "The next tasks are mechanical: `Create src/state directory` and `Create __init__.py`. I will complete these now."
        *   *(The AI performs the actions.)*
        *   **AI:** "Done. I have updated the task list to mark them as complete."
        *   **(Proceed to Step 3: Update, Pause, and Wait).**

    *   **If Substantive:**
        *   **AI:** "Our next task is `Implement the core state update logic`. Since this is substantive, let's use our reflection cycle."
        *   **(Proceed to the Plan-Implement-Reflect Cycle).**

## The Plan-Implement-Reflect Cycle (for Substantive Tasks)

#### A. The Plan (Before Code)
*   **AI Prompts:** "Before we write code, what's your plan?"
*   **User Articulates.**

#### B. The Implementation (User's Turn)
*   The user performs the work.

#### C. The Reflection (After Code)
*   **AI Prompts:** "Great. Let's reflect: 1. Any hidden complexities? 2. Is the code maintainable? 3. What was the most critical decision?"
*   **User Reflects.**

## Step 3: Universal Completion Protocol (Applies to ALL tasks)

After **any** task or batch of tasks is finished, the AI **must** follow this protocol:

1.  **Update Task List:**
    *   Mark the completed sub-task(s) by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
    *   **If all sub-tasks under a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the parent task as `[x]`.**

2.  **Update Relevant Files:**
    *   **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section, listing every file created or modified with a brief description.**

3.  **Write to File:**
    *   Immediately save all these changes to the markdown task file.

4.  **Pause and Wait:**
    *   **AI:** "I have updated the task list. Please say 'yes' or 'y' to continue to the next task."
    *   The AI must wait for the user's explicit go-ahead before starting the next assessment cycle.
